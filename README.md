# Students-Grade-Average-Calculation-and-analyzing-Student-Grades
A small python task used to calculate and analyze student Grades through CSV file
CSV Data Loading and Subject Average:  
We wrote a Python program to load student data from a CSV file and calculate the average grade for each subject. The results were printed in a tabular format.
Student Grade Analysis: 
We developed a Python program to analyze a dataset of student grades. The program calculated the average grade for each student and each subject and presented the results in a tabular format. We 
also implemented a function to convert numerical grades to letter grades.
Performance Improvement: 
Improved the performance of our data analysis by replacing a for loop with a while loop. We also implemented a function to convert average grades into letter grades and printed them.
